Write a Program to understand the concept of “a” File mode.


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
        FILE *fp=fopen("data2.txt","a");

        char a[20];
        printf("Enter the string\n");
        scanf("%s",a);

        fputs(a,fp);
        printf("\nData is saved successfully at the end of the file\n");
}
