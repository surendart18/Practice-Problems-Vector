Write a program to understand the concept of fseek() and ftell()


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
        FILE *fp=fopen("data.txt","r");

        if(fp==NULL)
        {
                printf("File doesn't exist\n");
                return 0;
        }

        fseek(fp,5,0);          // fpi increments 5 bytes from start position
        //fseek(fp,5,1);        // fpi increments 5 bytes from current position
        //fseek(fp,-5,2);       // fpi decrements 5 bytes from last position

        char ch;
        ch=fgetc(fp);           //reads character at current position, then pointer advances by 1 

        printf("ch=%c\n",ch);
        printf("file pointer position:%ld\n",ftell(fp));
}
