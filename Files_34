Write a program to see the difference between fwrite() and fprintf()


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
        int x=123456789;

        FILE *fp=fopen("data.txt","w");

        fprintf(fp,"%d",x);                  // writes the data in 9 bytes
        //fwrite(&x,sizeof(int),1,fp);       // writes the data in 4 bytes
}
